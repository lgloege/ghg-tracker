# GHG Tracker Project

*This is a work-in-progress*

The GHG Tracker Project provides comprehensive data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate targets, focusing on both national and subnational actors (e.g., states, provinces, cities). This project aims to centralize emission data and target information, enabling more effective analysis, comparison, and policy formulation. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, open-source database that serves as a reliable resource for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders.

The GHG Tracker Project collects and organizes data on GHG emissions by sector and gas when possible. It also integrates national and subnational emission reduction pledges. Additionally, the database includes contextual information such as population, GDP, and energy consumption to provide a fuller picture of emissions and their drivers.
